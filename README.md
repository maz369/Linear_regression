# Linear_regression
This notebook includes implementatoin of linear regression from sctrach. Mean sqaure error and goodness of fit (R^2) are also implemented 
based on mathematical definition.
It can be useful for those interested in understanding the basics of linear regression and want to contribute to optimizing this technique.
Overall complexity of for calling n (number of observations) and p (number of weights) is 2^np+p^3.

A toy data-set from Kaggel brain competition is also encluded to faciliate numerical results and visualizatoins.
